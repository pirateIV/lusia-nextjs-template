    "Anticipate the presence of a train at any moment. Trains operate around the clock on various tracks and directions. Don't be deceived by a train's proximity and speed. Estimating the distance and speed of a train can be challenging, especially at night. If you spot a train, exercise caution and wait.",
    "Be aware that trains cannot stop or change direction abruptly. When required to yield, expect a significant stopping distance. A loaded freight train traveling at 55 miles per hour, for instance, necessitates over a mile to come to a halt. When crossing gates are lowered or lights are flashing, come to a stop and patiently wait. Only proceed once the gates are raised, and the red lights have ceased flashing. Additionally, remember that when on foot, it's both illegal and perilous to be on or near railroad cars and tracks.",
    "These safety recommendations originate from Voith Turbo's experts in York, PA, a company that specializes in developing braking systems to enhance train travel. The innovative railcar, designed to save time and potentially lives, is gaining traction. These versatile Diesel Multiple Units (DMUs) enable seamless travel from suburban stations to city stations without the need to switch locomotives. According to Colorado Railcar Manufacturing, the company behind these cars, each DMU combines propulsion systems with passenger accommodations, accommodating 90 passengers and pulling additional motorized coaches.",
